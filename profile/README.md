# Open Source Program Office (OSPO) for the George Washington University

The GW [Open Source Program Office (OSPO)](http://ospo.gwu.edu) is dedicated to fostering a vibrant open source ecosystem within the university community. 
The office was established in 2023 with generous funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

Open source software is a central component of modern technology, promoting innovation and collaboration throughout both the commercial and non-profit sectors.  
The GW OSPO has been providing students, faculty, and staff with the knowledge and tools to contribute to and benefit from open source projects. 

The OSPO is part of the GW Libraries and Academic Innovation organization (LAI), providing a central location and trusted resources for the GW community.
